# WYSIWYG Form-Builder App

![App Demo](app_demo.gif)

## Overview

The WYSIWYG Form-Builder app is a powerful web application that allows users to create customized forms with a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) interface. This app was developed for our sponsor, Auxillium Group, to streamline the process of creating and managing forms for their internal and external use.

With this app, users can easily drag and drop form elements, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus, onto the canvas. They can then customize the appearance and behavior of these elements using the intuitive interface provided by Angular Material components.

## Key Features

- Customization Options: Users can customize the appearance of form elements, including colors, fonts, and layouts. Additionally, they can set validation rules for each element.

- Data Management: The app includes a backend API developed in PHP and a SQL Server database for securely storing form data submitted by users.
